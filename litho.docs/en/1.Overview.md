**Rationale**:
- Ensures quality control and alignment with user intent
- Maintains human oversight for critical architectural decisions
- Provides opportunities for course correction and refinement
- Builds user trust in AI-generated artifacts

#### 6.3.2 File-Based Artifact Storage

- Simplifies deployment and reduces external dependencies
- Provides transparent artifact inspection and manual intervention
- Supports version control integration through standard file formats
- Enables offline operation capabilities

#### 6.3.3 Modular Agent Design
**Decision**: Implement specialized agents for each development stage rather than monolithic AI approach.

**Rationale**:
- Enables focused expertise and optimized prompts per stage
- Supports incremental development and error recovery
- Facilitates independent improvement of individual agents
- Provides clear separation of concerns and responsibilities

#### 6.3.4 CLI-First Interface
**Decision**: Prioritize command-line interface over graphical interfaces.

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with developer workflows and tooling preferences
- Enables scripting and automation integration
- Reduces development complexity and maintenance overhead
- Supports remote and headless operation scenarios
