## 🖥️ Cowork CLI

### Iteration Management

```sh
# Initialize a new project
cowork init --name "My Project"

# Create a new iteration (Genesis)
cowork iter --project "my-project" "Build a REST API for task management"

# Create an evolution iteration
cowork iter --project "my-project" --base iter-1 --inherit partial "Add user profiles"

# List all iterations
cowork list

# Show iteration details
cowork show iter-1-1234567890

# Continue a paused iteration
cowork continue iter-1-1234567890

# Check status
cowork status
```

### Iteration Workflow

When you start an iteration, Cowork Forge guides you through the 7-stage workflow:

1. **Idea**: Your concept is structured into a formal specification
2. **PRD**: Product Requirements Document with actor-critic refinement
3. **Technical Design**: Architecture design with component specifications and actor-critic refinement
4. **Implementation Plan**: Task breakdown with dependencies and actor-critic refinement
5. **Coding**: Code implementation with actor-critic refinement and human validation
6. **Quality Check**: Verification of feature coverage and code completeness
7. **Delivery**: Final delivery report with implementation summary

At each critical stage, you'll be prompted to review and confirm the output before proceeding.

```sh
# List all iterations
$ cowork list
ID                     Title                    Status    Created At
iter-1-1770536303      Build a CLI tool         Completed 2023-12-01 10:30
iter-2-1770537500      Add batch processing      Paused    2023-12-01 14:45

# View iteration details
$ cowork show iter-1-1770536303

# Continue a paused iteration
$ cowork continue iter-2-1770537500

# Delete an iteration
$ cowork delete iter-2-1770537500

# Create an evolution iteration (based on existing)
$ cowork iter --title "Add batch processing" --base iter-1-1770536303 --inherit partial
```

### Inheritance Modes

When creating evolution iterations, you can choose from three inheritance modes:

| Mode        | Description                           | Use Case                          |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `none`      | Fresh start, no inheritance           | Complete rewrites, new projects   |
| `full`      | Copy workspace code + artifacts       | Bug fixes, small enhancements     |
| `partial`   | Copy artifacts only, regenerate code  | Large features, architecture change|

### Configuration Management

```sh
# Initialize configuration file
cowork init --name "My Project"

# Use custom configuration
cowork iter --title "Your idea" --config ./custom-config.toml

# List iterations with detailed status
cowork list --all

# Check current project status
cowork status
```
