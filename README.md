# 👋 What is Cowork Forge?

<strong>Cowork Forge</strong> is a complete AI-powered development team system that simulates how real software teams collaborate. AI agents take on roles as Product Manager, Architect, Project Manager, and Engineer, working together to complete everything from ideation to delivery.

Unlike AI coding assistants that only generate code snippets, Cowork Forge provides end-to-end development lifecycle management:
- **Product Manager AI**: Transforms your ideas into detailed Product Requirements Documents (PRD)
- **Architect AI**: Designs complete technical architecture and system components
- **Project Manager AI**: Breaks down tasks, plans dependencies, and defines implementation paths
- **Engineer AI**: Implements code, ensures quality, and generates delivery reports

Each role uses Actor-Critic patterns for self-review and optimization, with human validation at critical decision points to ensure output quality and direction.

<p align="center">
  <strong>One person can have a complete development team - Cowork Forge makes AI agents work for you like a real team.</strong>

## Key Differentiators

### 1. Complete Virtual Development Team

Unlike tools that only assist with writing code, Cowork Forge provides complete development team role coverage:
- **Product Manager Role**: Transforms vague ideas into structured Product Requirements Documents
- **Architect Role**: Designs complete technical architecture and system components
- **Project Manager Role**: Breaks down tasks, plans dependencies, and implementation paths
- **Engineer Role**: Implements code and performs quality verification

This full-role coverage ensures end-to-end continuity and professionalism from requirements analysis to code implementation.

### 2. Multi-Agent Collaboration
Cowork Forge's specialized agents work together like a real development team:
- <strong>Idea Agent</strong>: Captures and structures user requirements
- <strong>PRD Loop Agent</strong>: Generates comprehensive PRDs with actor-critic refinement
- <strong>Design Loop Agent</strong>: Creates technical architecture with actor-critic refinement
- <strong>Plan Loop Agent</strong>: Breaks down implementation tasks with actor-critic refinement
- <strong>Coding Loop Agent</strong>: Plans and executes code changes with actor-critic refinement
- <strong>Check Agent</strong>: Verifies code quality and completeness
- <strong>Delivery Agent</strong>: Generates comprehensive delivery reports
- <strong>Modify Agent</strong>: Analyzes and handles incremental change requests
- <strong>Code Patch Agent</strong>: Implements precise code patches
- <strong>Modify Delivery Agent</strong>: Generates modification delivery reports

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop Validation
Critical outputs require human confirmation before proceeding, ensuring:
- Accurate requirement capture
- Sound technical decisions
- Feasible implementation plans
- Safe code changes

This balance of automation and human control sets Cowork Forge apart from fully autonomous tools.

### 4. Incremental Code Updates
When requirements or designs change, Cowork Forge intelligently identifies affected files and updates only what's necessary—preserving your customizations and avoiding full regeneration.

### 5. Built-in Safety
Multi-layer security checks prevent:
- Dangerous command execution (rm -rf, sudo, etc.)
- Unauthorized file system access
- Malicious code injection
- Resource exhaustion

## Key Components

### Pipeline Orchestrator
Manages session lifecycle, stage dependencies, and workflow execution with support for full and partial pipeline assembly.

### AI Agents
Specialized agents work collaboratively, each responsible for a specific stage of the development lifecycle. Four agents (PRD, Design, Plan, Coding) use actor-critic loop patterns for iterative refinement with human feedback. Includes: Idea, PRD, Design, Plan, Coding, Check, Delivery, Modify, CodePatch, ModifyDelivery.

### Instruction Templates
Provides specialized prompt templates for each agent, defining their behavior and output format.

### Tools Module
Safe file operations and command execution with security checks and resource limits.

### LLM Integration Layer
Manages interactions with large language models, including rate limiting, API clients, and request optimization.

### Data Module
Defines system data models and session management mechanisms.

### Storage Module
Provides persistent data management and retrieval capabilities.

# 🧠 How It Works

Cowork Forge uses a sophisticated multi-stage workflow orchestrated by the `Orchestrator`:

```

# 🖥 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org) (version 1.70 or later)
- [**OpenAI API Key**](https://platform.openai.com/) for LLM access
- Git and language-specific build tools (cargo, npm, pip, etc.)

### Installation

Build from source:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sopaco/cowork-forge.git
cd cowork-forge

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# The CLI binary will be available at:
# target/release/cowork
```

### Configuration

Cowork Forge uses a `config.toml` file for configuration. Create one in your project directory or use `--config` to specify a path:

```toml
# LLM Configuration
[llm]
api_base_url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
api_key = "sk-your-openai-api-key"
model_name = "gpt-5-codex"
```

# 🚀 Usage

### Starting a New Development Session

```sh
# Start a new project with an idea
cowork new "Build a REST API for a task management application"

# Start with a configuration file
cowork new "Create a web dashboard" --config ./config.toml

# Resume an existing project
cowork resume
```

### Session Workflow

When you start a session, Cowork Forge will guide you through the 7-stage workflow:

1. **Idea Intake**: Your idea is structured into a formal specification (idea.md)
2. **PRD Generation**: A comprehensive Product Requirements Document with actor-critic refinement
3. **Technical Design**: Architecture design with component specifications and actor-critic refinement
4. **Implementation Plan**: Task breakdown with dependencies and actor-critic refinement
5. **Coding**: Code implementation with actor-critic refinement and human validation
6. **Quality Check**: Verification of feature coverage and code completeness
7. **Delivery**: Final delivery report with implementation summary

At each critical stage, you'll be prompted to review and confirm the output before proceeding.

### Example Session Flow

```sh
$ cowork new "Build a CLI tool for file conversion"

[Stage 1/7] Idea Agent
Analyzing your requirement...

# 🌐 The Cowork Forge Ecosystem

Cowork Forge is organized as a modular Rust workspace with clear separation of concerns:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "User Interface"
        CLI["cowork-cli"]
    end

    subgraph "Core System"
        Core["cowork-core"]
    end
    
    subgraph "External Services"
        LLM[("OpenAI LLM")]
        FS[("File System")]
        CMD[("Command Line")]
    end

    %% Define Dependencies
    CLI --> Core
    
    Core --> LLM
    Core --> FS
    Core --> CMD
```

- <strong>`cowork-core`</strong>: The heart of the system containing all business logic, agents, orchestrator, and supporting modules.
- <strong>`cowork-cli`</strong>: Command-line interface for interacting with the Cowork system.

### Core Modules

<strong>cowork-core</strong> is organized into the following domain modules:

- <strong>`pipeline`</strong>: Workflow pipeline orchestration managing session lifecycle and stage execution.
- <strong>`agents`</strong>: Specialized AI agents (Idea, PRD, Design, Plan, Coding, Check, Delivery, Modify, CodePatch, ModifyDelivery).
- <strong>`instructions`</strong>: Prompt templates for each agent.
- <strong>`tools`</strong>: File operations and command execution with safety checks.
- <strong>`llm`</strong>: LLM integration layer including rate limiting and API clients.
- <strong>`data`</strong>: Data models and session management.
- <strong>`storage`</strong>: Data persistence and retrieval.


# 🔒 Security

Cowork Forge implements multiple layers of security:

1. **Command Validation**: Dangerous commands are blocked before execution
2. **Path Access Control**: Restricted access to sensitive system directories
3. **Build Tool Whitelist**: Only authorized development tools can be executed
4. **Timeout Controls**: Prevents resource exhaustion from long-running commands
5. **Watchdog Monitoring**: Detects and prevents agent deviation from objectives
